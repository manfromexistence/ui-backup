# Migrating to v6

<p class="description">This guide explains how and why to migrate from Material UI v5 to v6.</p>

## Start using the beta release

In your `package.json` file, change the package version from `latest` to `next`.

```diff title="package.json"
-"@mui/material": "latest",
+"@mui/material": "next",
```

Optionally, if you are using one of these packages, you can also change their version to `next`:

- `@mui/icons-material`
- `@mui/system`
- `@mui/lab`
- `@mui/material-nextjs`
- `@mui/styled-engine-sc`
- `@mui/utils`

Using `next` ensures your project always uses the latest v6 beta release.
Alternatively, you can also target and fix it to a specific version, for example, `6.0.0-beta.0`.

## Why you should migrate

Material UI v6's biggest highlight is the introduction of Pigment CSS, a next-gen zero-runtime CSS-in-JS library, as an opt-in styling engine.
Using it will make your project compatible with React Server Components, as well as help reduce its bundle size due to styles being extracted at build time, avoiding client-side recalculation.

As a lesson learned from v5, this major release introduces minimal breaking changes.
Namely, browser support updates, a Node.js version bump, and the removal of the UMD bundle.
These updates reduced the Material UI package size by 2.5MB, 25% of the total size, and can be, for the most part, migrated automatically via codemods.

Aside from that, v6 also includes a few quality-of-life improvements regarding styling:

- The `CssVarsProvider` API is now stable. That enables you to rely on CSS variables, allowing for more intricate and performant customization possibilities, along with improved overall developer experience.
- Support for container queries within the theme.
- A new theme utility for adding styles to specific color modes.

## Supported browsers and Node versions

The targets of the default bundle have changed in v6.

The exact versions will be pinned on release from the browserslist query: `"> 0.5%, last 2 versions, Firefox ESR, not dead, safari >= 15.4, iOS >= 15.4"`.

<!-- #stable-snapshot -->

- Node.js 14 (up from 12)
- Chrome 109 (up from 90)
- Edge 121 (up from 91)
- Firefox 115 (up from 78)
- Safari 15.4 in both macOS and iOS (up from 14 in macOS and 12.5 in iOS)
- and more (see [.browserslistrc `stable` entry](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/v6.0.0/.browserslistrc#L11))

### Removed support for IE 11

Support for IE 11－that is, the legacy bundle and all IE 11-related code－is completely removed.
This decreases Material UI's bundle size and eases future development.

If you need to support IE 11, you can use v5's [legacy bundle](https://v5.mui.com/material-ui/guides/minimizing-bundle-size/#legacy-bundle).
However, note that it won't get updates or bug fixes.

## Update React & TypeScript version

### Update React

The minimum supported version of React is v17.0.0 (the same as v5).
Use the snippet below to update your project (replace the `<version>` with the one you want):

<codeblock storageKey="package-manager">

```bash npm
npm install react@<version> react-dom@<version>
```

```bash yarn
yarn add react@<version> react-dom@<version>
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add react@<version> react-dom@<version>
```

</codeblock>

### Update TypeScript

The minimum supported version of TypeScript has been increased from v3.5 to 4.7.

:::info
We align with types released by [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) (published on npm under the `@types` namespace).

We will not change the minimum supported version in a minor version of Material UI.
However, we recommend not using a TypeScript version older than the lowest supported version by DefinitelyTyped.
:::

If your project includes these packages, you'll need to update them:

- `@types/react`
- `@types/react-dom`

:::warning
Make sure that your application is still running without errors, and commit the changes before continuing to the next step.

## Breaking changes

:::info
This list is a work in progress.
Expect updates as new breaking changes are introduced.
:::

### UMD bundle was removed

To align with React 19's removal of UMD builds, Material UI has also removed its UMD bundle.
This results in a reduction of the `@mui/material` package size by 2.5MB or 25% of the total package size.
See [Package Phobia](https://packagephobia.com/result?p=@mui/material) for more details.

Instead, using ESM-based CDNs such as [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/) is recommended.
For alternative installation methods, refer to the [CDN documentation](/material-ui/getting-started/installation/#cdn).

### Autocomplete

#### New reason values added to onInputChange

Three new possible values have been added to the `reason` argument in the `onInputChange` callback of the Autocomplete component.
These three were previously treated as `"reset"`, so if you are relying on that, you might need to adjust your code accordingly:

- `"blur"`: like `"reset"` but triggered when the focus is moved off the input. `clearOnBlur` must be `true`.
- `"selectOption"`: triggered when the input value changes after an option has been selected.
- `"removeOption"`: triggered in multiple selection when a chip gets removed due to the corresponding option being selected.

These are added on top of the existing ones: `"input"`, `"reset"`, and `"clear"`.

### Accordion

#### Heading element wrapping Accordion Summary

To meet the [W3C Accordion Pattern standard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/), the Accordion Summary is now wrapped with a default `h3` heading element. This change may affect customizations relying on the previous DOM structure and CSS specificity. Additionally, the default heading element might conflict with existing heading structures on your page.

If your styles or DOM manipulations depend on the old structure, you will need to update them to accommodate the new heading element. If the default heading element conflicts with your existing structure, you can change the heading element using the `slotProps.heading.component` prop.

```jsx
<Accordion slotProps={{ heading: { component: 'h4' } }}>
  <AccordionSummary
    expandIcon={<ExpandMoreIcon />}
    aria-controls="panel1-content"
    id="panel1-header"
  >
    Accordion
  </AccordionSummary>
  <AccordionDetails>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse malesuada
    lacus ex, sit amet blandit leo lobortis eget.
  </AccordionDetails>
</Accordion>
```

### Chip

Previously, the Chip component lost focus when the escape button was pressed, which differed from how other button-like components work.
This issue has been resolved, and the Chip now retains focus as expected.

If you want to keep the previous behavior, add a custom `onKeyUp` handler, as shown below:

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import Chip from '@mui/material/Chip';

export default function ChipExample() {
  const chipRef = React.useRef(null);
  const keyUpHandler = (event) => {
    if (event.key === 'Escape' && chipRef.current) {
      chipRef.current.blur();
    }
  };
  return (
    <Chip
      label="Chip Outlined"
      variant="outlined"
      ref={chipRef}
      onKeyUp={keyUpHandler}
    />
  );
}
```

### Loading Button

The `children` passed to the Loading Button component is now wrapped in a `<span>` tag to avoid [issues](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/27853) when using tools to translate websites.

### Grid v2 (Unstable_Grid)

The `Grid2` was updated and stabilized:

- The previous size (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, ...) and offset (`xsOffset`, `smOffset`, `mdOffset`, ...) props, which were named after the theme's breakpoints, were replaced with the `size` and `offset` props.
- The spacing mechanism was reworked to use the `gap` CSS property.

This brings some breaking changes described in the following sections.

### ListItem

`ListItem`'s props `autoFocus`, `button`, `disabled`, and `selected`, deprecated in v5, have been removed. To replace the `button` prop, use `ListItemButton` instead. The other removed props are available in the `ListItemButton` component as well.

```diff
-<ListItem button />
+<ListItemButton />
```

Use this codemod to migrate your project to the `ListItemButton` component:

```bash
npx @mui/codemod@next v6.0.0/list-item-button-prop <path/to/folder>
```

As the `ListItem` no longer supports these props, the class names related to these props were removed. You should use the `listItemButtonClasses` object instead.

```diff
-import { listItemClasses } from '@mui/material/ListItem';
+import { listItemButtonClasses } from '@mui/material/ListItemButton';

- listItemClasses.button
+ listItemButtonClasses.root

- listItemClasses.focusVisible
+ listItemButtonClasses.focusVisible

- listItemClasses.disabled
+ listItemButtonClasses.disabled

- listItemClasses.selected
+ listItemButtonClasses.selected
```

#### Stabilized API

The `Grid2` component API was stabilized, so its import no longer contains the `Unstable_` prefix:

```diff
-import { Unstable_Grid2 as Grid2 } from '@mui/material';
+import { Grid2 } from '@mui/material';
```

```diff
-import Grid from '@mui/material/Unstable_Grid2';
+import Grid from '@mui/material/Grid2';
```

#### Size and offset props

Previously, the size and offset props were named corresponding to the theme's breakpoints.
For the default theme this was:

- Size: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`
- Offset: `xsOffset`, `smOffset`, `mdOffset`, `lgOffset`, `xlOffset`

In v6, these props are renamed to `size` and `offset`:

```diff
 <Grid
-  xs={12}
-  sm={6}
-  xsOffset={2}
-  smOffset={3}
+  size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6 }}
+  offset={{ xs: 2, sm: 3 }}
 >
```

Note that if the size or offset is the same for all breakpoints, you can use a single value:

```diff
-<Grid xs={6} xsOffset={2}>
+<Grid size={6} offset={2}>
```

Besides that, the `true` value for the size prop was renamed to `"grow"`:

```diff
-<Grid xs>
+<Grid size="grow">
```

Use this codemod to migrate your project to the new size and offset props:

```bash
npx @mui/codemod@next v6.0.0/grid-v2-props <path/to/folder>
```

:::warning
You need to modify the import from `@mui/material/Unstable_Grid2` to `@mui/material/Grid2` before running the codemod.
:::

If you have custom breakpoints, the change is the same:

```diff
-<Grid mobile={12} mobileOffset={2} desktop={6} desktopOffset={4}>
+<Grid size={{ mobile: 12, desktop: 6 }} offset={{ mobile: 2, desktop: 4 }}>
```

Which you can cover with the same codemod by providing the custom breakpoints as an argument:

```bash
npx @mui/codemod@next v6.0.0/grid-v2-props <path/to/folder> --jscodeshift='--muiBreakpoints=mobile,desktop'
```

#### Removal of the disableEqualOverflow prop

Previously, the Grid overflowed its parent.
In v6, this is fixed, with the Grid being contained inside its parent's padding:

<img src="/static/material-ui/migration-v5/grid-overflow-change.png" style="width: 814px;" alt="Before and after of the Grid no longer overflowing its parent in v6." width="1628" height="400" />

This removes the need for the `disableEqualOverflow` prop:

```diff
-<Grid disableEqualOverflow>
+<Grid>
```

#### Spacing is no longer considered inside the Grid item's box

Previously, Grid items included spacing in their boxes.
In v6, this is fixed:

<img src="/static/material-ui/migration-v5/grid-spacing-change.png" style="width: 814px;" alt="Before and after of the Grid items no longer including spacing in their box." width="1628" height="400" />

:::warning
Both of these changes might slightly affect your layout.
Note that the items' position doesn't change.
We recommend adopting this new behavior and **not trying to replicate the old one**, as this is a more predictable and modern approach.
:::

### Rating

Previously, due to a bug, the `aria-label` attribute was "null Stars" when no value was set in the Rating component.
This is fixed in v6, with the `aria-label` attribute being "0 Stars" when no value is set.

### useMediaQuery

The following deprecated types were removed:

- `MuiMediaQueryList`: use `MediaQueryList` (from lib.dom.d.ts) instead.
- `MuiMediaQueryListEvent`: use `MediaQueryListEvent` (from lib.dom.d.ts) instead.
- `MuiMediaQueryListListener`: use `(event: MediaQueryListEvent) => void` instead.

## Stabilized APIs

### CssVarsProvider and extendTheme

The `CssVarsProvider` and `extendTheme` APIs are now stable.
If you already use them in v5, you can now drop the experimental prefix.

```diff
-import { experimental_extendTheme as extendTheme, Experimental_CssVarsProvider as CssVarsProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';
+import { extendTheme, CssVarsProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';
```

Check out the [CSS theme variables page](/material-ui/customization/css-theme-variables/overview/) to learn more about it.

### Add styles for specific color modes

Material UI v6 introduces a new utility for adding styles to specific color modes called `theme.applyStyles`.
It's designed to replace `theme.palette.mode` when applying light or dark styles.

```diff
 const MyComponent = styled('button')(({ theme }) => ({
   padding: '0.5rem 1rem',
   border: '1px solid,
-  borderColor: theme.palette.mode === 'dark' ? '#fff' : '#000',
+  borderColor: '#000',
+  ...theme.applyStyles('dark', {
+    borderColor: '#fff',
+  })
 }))
```

Use these codemods to migrate your project to `theme.applyStyles`:

```bash
npx @mui/codemod@next v6.0.0/styled <path/to/folder-or-file>
npx @mui/codemod@next v6.0.0/sx-prop <path/to/folder-or-file>
npx @mui/codemod@next v6.0.0/theme-v6 <path/to/theme-file>
```

:::info
Run `v6.0.0/theme-v6` against the file that contains the custom `styleOverrides`. Ignore this codemod if you don't have a custom theme.
:::

## Deprecations

### Components props

The `components` and `componentsProps` props have been deprecated in favor of `slots` and `slotProps`, making the API surface of the components more consistent.

Check out the [deprecations page](/material-ui/migration/migrating-from-deprecated-apis/) to learn which component no longer has these props.

### System props

System props, such as `mt={*}`, `bgcolor={*}`, and others, are deprecated in the Box, Typography, Link, Grid, and Stack components.
Move all system props into the `sx` prop by using the codemod below:

```bash
npx @mui/codemod@next v6.0.0/system-props <path/to/folder>
```

Or do it manually like the example below:

```diff
-<Button mr={2}>
+<Button sx={{ mr: 2 }}>
```

### Theme component variants

Custom component variants defined in the theme are now merged with the theme style overrides, defined within the `root` slot of the component.
Update the theme file using the codemod:

```bash
npx @mui/codemod@next v6.0.0/theme-v6 <path/to/theme>
```

Or do it manually like the example below:

```diff
 createTheme({
   components: {
     MuiButton: {
-      variants: [ ... ],
+      styleOverrides: {
+        root: {
+          variants: [ ... ]
+        }
+      }
     }
   }
 })
```

This reduces the API surface and lets you define variants in other slots of the component.

## Pigment CSS integration (optional)

Check out the [Pigment CSS migration page](/material-ui/migration/migrating-to-pigment-css/) to learn how to integrate it into your project.
