# React Templates

<p class="description">Browse our collection of free React templates to get started building your app with Material UI, including a React dashboard, React marketing page, and more.</p>

## Free templates

Our curated collection of free Material UI templates includes dashboards, marketing pages, sign-in and sign-up pages, a blog, a checkout flow, and more.
They can be combined with one of the [example projects](/material-ui/getting-started/example-projects/) to form a complete starter.

Sections of each layout are clearly defined either by comments or use of separate files,
making it simple to extract parts of a page (such as a "hero unit", or footer, for example)
for reuse in other pages.
For multi-part examples, a table in the README at the linked source code location describes
the purpose of each file.
